# 3d-Portfolio
testing links and navigation in a-frame
for optimization:
preload assets in index.html
if you have to navigate back to index.html, it will take ages reloading assets again
so, create a index clone.
use https://squoosh.app/editor to optimize images 
keep the polys low: obvs

todo:
get basic physics working alongside navigation.
test storing variables into local storage
then perhaps a database
investigate validity of networking frameworks to enable multiple users
apply user authentication

check this out - you will have to roll back to 3.5.1 and make sure you have gltf exporter 2.0
